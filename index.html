The container support makes it a good CI tool to assess. [More ...](https://concourse.ci/index.html){:target='_blank'}"},{"name":"Jenkins","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Hold","isNew":true,"description":"[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/){:target='_blank'} is the CI tool which comes with a lot of features and plugins that enable it to be a unified build and automation tool. [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) wasn't build from the ground up to support Continuous Delivery, hence lacked native support for pipelines and visualizations that we were able to get from GoCD."},{"name":"Ansible","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Adopt","isNew":true,"description":"[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} is an open-source automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. The agent-less architecture which enables us to create automation and manage configurations with very little effort makes us to adopt Ansible as our CM tool. Also it comes with other features like provisioning and deployment automation."},{"name":"Chef-solo","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Adopt","isNew":true,"description":"[Chef-solo](https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html){:target='_blank'} is a command that executes chef-client in a way that does not require the Chef server in order to converge cookbooks. Similar to [ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} we like the agent-less architecture and the in-house expertise made it easier to adopt Chef-solo."},{"name":"Chef-server","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Adopt","isNew":true,"description":"[Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef){:target='_blank'} is a CM tool that enables you to manage small to large scale datacentres on and off the cloud with its client server model where the client reaches out to the server periodically to sync its configurations. Being a client sever model it has a lot of moving parts and comes with a host of challenges like Server bottleneck, Single point of failure, complicated architecture hence we put it on hold."},{"name":"Terraform","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Trial","isNew":true,"description":"[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io){:target='_blank'} is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. The ability to create immutable infra backed with good community support encouraged us to try [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) at Indix."},{"name":"Cloudformation","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Hold","isNew":true,"description":"[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) provides an easy way to create and manage a collection of related [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com){:target='_blank'} resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. The obvious problem that we had with this tool was that it was only [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com){:target='_blank'} specific, and the complicated JSON required to create templates didn't help either hence we put it on hold."},{"name":"Bind","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Hold","isNew":true,"description":"[BIND](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind) is open source software that enables you to publish your Domain Name System (DNS) information on the Internet, and to resolve DNS queries for your users.

At Indix we are using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} for both CM and provisioning so it made it simpler to choose the same over [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com){:target='_blank'} as [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com){:target='_blank'} didn't bring anything new to the table than what [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} had to offer in terms of deployments."},{"name":"Splunk","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Hold","isNew":true,"description":"[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com){:target='_blank'} is a log management tool that can be used to monitor and analyze the data collected. The data collected can then be used to generate graphs, reports, alerts and dashboards. At Indix we just need a simple and cost-effective tool for log management and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com){:target='_blank'} was too costly for us hence we put it on hold."},{"name":"Loggly","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Adopt","isNew":true,"description":"[Loggly](https://www.loggly.com){:target='_blank'} is a cloud based log management tool where you simply install a client on your server and the log is shipped to a central unit for management. At Indix, we adopted [loggly](https://www.loggly.com){:target='_blank'} as it was economical, well managed, cloud based and had a decent functionality for analytics"},{"name":"ELK","quadrant":"Tools","ring":"Hold","isNew":true,"description":"[ElasticSearch Logstash Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack){:target='_blank'} is a combination of open source tools which can used for log management. Its one of the commonly used tools for log management in the industry. At Indix we were looking for a managed service and [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack){:target='_blank'} stack has a complex architecture and needs effort to manage in house, and for all the effort you put in its fairly costly to build, there is no licensing cost but running a HA/ Scalable stack of [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack){:target='_blank'} wasn't cost effective hence we put it on hold. Also, in [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com){:target='_blank'} - defining alerts as and when required is simple, can be done via UI."},{"name":"Docker","quadrant":"Platforms","ring":"Adopt","isNew":true,"description":"[Docker](https://www.docker.com){:target='_blank'} is synonymous to containers and we at Indix like the ease of use and portability that it offers and have adopted it for Dev/CI environments. The kernel compatibility issues that [Docker](https://www.docker.com){:target='_blank'} had didn't give sufficient confidence to adopt it across all Production environments yet hence its put on hold."},{"name":"Rkt","quadrant":"Platforms","ring":"Assess","isNew":true,"description":"[Rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt){:target='_blank'} is a pod-native container engine for Linux.

We liked the more frequent updates that come as part of Ubuntu rather than the slower updates in case of [Centos](https://www.centos.org){:target='_blank'}. Also the user community in case of Centos is not as huge as Ubuntu, hence we put it on hold."},{"name":"Ubuntu","quadrant":"Platforms","ring":"Adopt","isNew":true,"description":"[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com){:target='_blank'} is one of the most popular debian Linux distros out there. We at Indix like the active community support, frequent updates and arguably the best package management."},{"name":"Mesos","quadrant":"Platforms","ring":"Adopt","isNew":true,"description":"[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org){:target='_blank'} abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

At Indix, we liked the scale, reliability and flexibility that [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com){:target='_blank'} had to offer. Also being the leading IAAS provider in the market it has good integration with the best tools for provisioning and automation required to manage a tool like this."},{"name":"Google Cloud","quadrant":"Platforms","ring":"Assess","isNew":true,"description":"[Google's version of the IAAS](https://cloud.google.com){:target='_blank'}, offering similar tools and feature set as other providers in the market. Google seems to offer better data-processing and data-flow compared to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com){:target='_blank'} hence we at Indix wanted to assess it."},{"name":"Azure","quadrant":"Platforms","ring":"Hold","isNew":true,"description":"[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in){:target='_blank'} is the IAAS offering from Microsoft.

It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. Python already filled the need for the high level language that [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash){:target='_blank'} couldn't fill and since we work a lot on Ansible(which is built in python) integrations were also lot more easier with [python](https://www.python.org){:target='_blank'} hence we put [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en){:target='_blank'} on hold."},{"name":"Go","quadrant":"Languages","ring":"Trial","isNew":true,"description":"[Go](https://golang.org){:target='_blank'} is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software."}]</pre>
