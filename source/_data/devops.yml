  description: "[GoCd](https://www.gocd.io/){:target='_blank'} is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery System developed by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/go/) which was open sourced in 2014."
  opinion: "The native support for pipelines as first class citizen, parallelism of jobs inside stages while keeping separate stages for sequential dependencies and better visualizations compared to other tools made GoCD our tool of choice at Indix. We also had in house expertise (few of the members literally built the tool) that motivated us to consider it in the first place. Over time, we gained more maturity and have been actively working on contributing to various developments around it. Check out [S3 Artifacts Plugin](https://github.com/indix/gocd-s3-artifacts), [Agents auto-scaler on top of Mesos](https://github.com/indix/gocd-mesos) and [auto-scaling with containers](https://github.com/indix/vasuki)."

  description: "[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/){:target='_blank'} is probably the most popular CI tool around which comes with a lot of features and plugins that enable it to be a unified build and automation tool."
  opinion: "Wasn't build from the ground up to support Continuous Delivery, hence lacked native support for pipelines and visualizations that we were able to get from GoCD."

  quadrant: Tools
  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: "[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} is an open-source automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management and application deployment."
  opinion: "The agent-less architecture enables us to create automation and manage configurations/ deployment with very little effort. Also, it comes with a matured support for provisioning and deployment as well. Its simplicity compared to other complex tools was another reason behind our decision."

  isNew: true
  description: "[Chef-solo](https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html){:target='_blank'} is a command that executes chef-client in a way that does not require the Chef server in order to converge cookbooks. Similar to [ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} we like the agent-less architecture and the in-house expertise made it easier to adopt Chef-solo."
  opinion: "Chef has been our only CM tool from the very beginning and naturally we have grown expertise over time. Similar to [ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'}, with the server-less architecture of chef-solo we have been able to scale configuration management without any issues in hundreds of m/c in various clusters."

  description: "[Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef){:target='_blank'} is a CM tool that enables you to manage large scale datacentres on and off the cloud with its client server model where the client reaches out to the server periodically to sync its configurations."
  opinion: "The server side of Chef has a lot of moving parts (Think about Nginx/ RabbitMQ/ Postgres/ Flat-file storage/ Rails together) that needs lot of efforts to maintain. Also, scaling horizontally and making it highly available with the open source version poses another challenge altogether. We didn't find it appropriate to continue using it given that we had much simpler alternatives at hand."

  opinion: "The obvious problem that we had with this tool was that it was AWS specific, and the complicated JSON required to create templates didn't help either hence we put it on hold."

  description: "[BIND](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind) is open source software that enables you to publish your Domain Name System (DNS) information on the Internet, and to resolve DNS queries for your users. At Indix we were in favor of a managed DNS service hence we put [Bind](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind) on hold."
  opinion: "We started with Bind since our inception but over time we realized the managing and scaling a DNS infra is far more complicated than one thinks. Given that many hosted DNS solutions came up over time, we favored to move away from maintaining our own infrastructure for such a super-critical component like DNS."

  opinion: "Route53 has matured a lot since it was released years back. Features like Private hosted zones, Vpc association, DNS aliasing (Very useful for Zone Apex)", multiple routing policies have been tremendously useful for us. Along with those, having a scalable & highly-available DNS service without any headache of maintenance made us to choose it without a second thought."

  opinion: "At Indix we are using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} for both CM and provisioning so it made it simpler to choose the same over [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com){:target='_blank'} as Capistrano didn't bring anything new to the table than what [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} had to offer in terms of deployments."

  opinion: "At Indix we just needed a simple and cost-effective tool for log management/ alerting & reporting. Even though we started with Splunk initially, it turned out to be too costly for us and hence we put it on hold."

  opinion: "At Indix we preferred a managed service for centralized logging since the complex architecture and efforts needed to manage an in-house ELK stack sounded too much. On top of that, building a HA/ Scalable stack of ELK wasn't cost effective given the amount of logs we deal with on a daily basis. Also, there were features that we wanted to have like defining alerts from UI, being able to use derived field etc were missing in ELK."
