  description: "[GoCd](https://www.gocd.io/) is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery System developed by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/go/) which was open sourced in 2014."
  opinion: "The native support for pipelines as first class citizen, parallelism of jobs inside stages while keeping separate stages for sequential dependencies and better visualizations compared to other tools made GoCD our tool of choice at Indix. We also had in house expertise (few of the members literally built the tool) that motivated us to consider it in the first place. Over time, we gained more maturity and have been actively working on contributing to various developments around it.

Also, it comes with a matured support for provisioning and deployment as well. Its simplicity compared to other complex tools was another reason behind our decision."

Similar to [ansible](https://www.ansible.com) we like the agent-less architecture and the in-house expertise made it easier to adopt Chef-solo."
  opinion: "Chef has been our only CM tool from the very beginning and naturally we have grown expertise over time. Similar to [ansible](https://www.ansible.com), with the server-less architecture of chef-solo we have been able to scale configuration management without any issues in hundreds of m/c in various clusters."

  description: "[Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef) is a CM tool that enables you to manage large scale datacentres on and off the cloud with its client server model where the client reaches out to the server periodically to sync its configurations."
  opinion: "The server side of Chef has a lot of moving parts (Think about Nginx/ RabbitMQ/ Postgres/ Flat-file storage/ Rails together) that needs lot of efforts to maintain. Also, scaling horizontally and making it highly available with the open source version poses another challenge altogether. We didn't find it appropriate to continue using it given that we had much simpler alternatives at hand."

  opinion: "We started with Bind since our inception but over time we realized the managing and scaling a DNS infra is far more complicated than one thinks.

Features like Private hosted zones, Vpc association, DNS aliasing (Very useful for Zone Apex), multiple routing policies have been tremendously useful for us.

  opinion: "At Indix we preferred a managed service for centralized logging since the complex architecture and efforts needed to manage an in-house ELK stack sounded too much. On top of that, building a HA/ Scalable stack of ELK wasn't cost effective given the amount of logs we deal with on a daily basis. Also, there were features that we wanted to have like defining alerts from UI, being able to use derived field etc were missing in ELK."
