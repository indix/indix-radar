  opinion: "The native support for pipelines as first class citizen, parallelism of jobs inside stages while keeping separate stages for sequential dependencies and better visualizations compared to other tools made GoCD our tool of choice at Indix. We also had in house expertise (few of the members literally built the tool) that motivated us to consider it in the first place. Over time, we gained more maturity and have been actively working on contributing to various developments around it.

Similar to [ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target='_blank'} we like the agent-less architecture and the in-house expertise made it easier to adopt Chef-solo."
  opinion: "Chef has been our only CM tool from the very beginning and naturally we have grown expertise over time.

  opinion: "The server side of Chef has a lot of moving parts (Think about Nginx/ RabbitMQ/ Postgres/ Flat-file storage/ Rails together) that needs lot of efforts to maintain. Also, scaling horizontally and making it highly available with the open source version poses another challenge altogether. We didn't find it appropriate to continue using it given that we had much simpler alternatives at hand."

  opinion: "We started with Bind since our inception but over time we realized the managing and scaling a DNS infra is far more complicated than one thinks.

  opinion: "At Indix we preferred a managed service for centralized logging since the complex architecture and efforts needed to manage an in-house ELK stack sounded too much. On top of that, building a HA/ Scalable stack of ELK wasn't cost effective given the amount of logs we deal with on a daily basis.
