  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: '[ECMAScript 2015 (initially referred to as ES6)](http://es6-features.org/){:target="_blank"} was finalized in June 2015 and introduces new syntax for writing complex applications (including classes & modules) and is generally a sorely needed upgrade to the language. As of Q1 2017, majority of the ES6 features are supported by the common browsers. The not supported ES6 features can be used with the [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler.'
  opinion: Indix has been active adopter of ES6 features ever since it's inception, initially through transpilers and later as direct features. Apps written without ES6 features are being rewritten.

  ring: Hold
  isNew: true
  description: "[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/){:target='_blank'} is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability."
  opinion: Indix started using CoffeeScript in 2015. The primary reason was to reduce boiler plate code that we were writing due to JavaScript idiosyncarnies. Example - [Pros and cons of CoffeeScript](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/72569/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-coffeescript). It did improve our productivity during the time of usage and multiple apps based out of CoffeeScript run in production. But as of 2017 Q1, we no longer use it because ES2015/ES6 solves a lot of the problems that CoffeeScript was trying to solve without drastic syntax changes. Migration of existing apps to ES6 is in backlog and will be picked on case-by-case basis.

  isNew: true
  description: "[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) is a JavaScript syntax extension that looks similar to XML. It is developed by Facebook and is acknowledged for the benefit of writing composable micro-components."
  opinion: Indix has been active user of React JSX ever since it's beta stage. The ability to define every UI element as a component and pass-on rich state to the components are very benefitial. Lesser number of bugs are being observed in production apps as the views are reactive to how the state of the app changes.

  ring: Assess
  isNew: true
  description: "[Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) are a set of standards currently being produced by Google engineers as a W3C specification that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications."
  opinion: Indix assessed WebComponents in its early alpha stages and found it promising for the core concept of representing every visual item as a component. From the time it's assessed, the list of components repository has grown drastically and Indix is looking forward to trying Web Components in one of its upcoming project.

  description: "[LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is a CSS pre-processor; it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themeable and extendable."
  opinion: Indix is a major consumer of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and ever since Bootstrap made SASS as its default, Indix has put LESS on hold. All existing apps are already migrated to SASS.
- name: SASS
  quadrant: Languages & Techniques
  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: "[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is an extension of CSS and defines a clean structured way of writing CSS by allowing to modularize CSS snippets while offering a whole slew of features which are practised in javascript environment. Features like variables, external imports, functions and extensibility allow to experience the benefits of modular patterns."
  opinion: Given its advantages, Indix actively adopts Sass for styling its web apps. Sass added defined structure to app styling code base and made it easily readable. The extensible nature allowed us to define low level themes and reuse it across apps.
- name: PostCSS
  quadrant: Languages & Techniques
  ring: Assess
  isNew: true
  description: PostCSS was launched as a method to use JavaScript for CSS processing. PostCSS on its own is simply an API, which, when used with its vast ecosystem of plugins, offers powerful abilities. 
  opinion: Because of its promising custom plugins and tools for transforming styles, Indix is actively assessing the language. Only apps which need more than what Sass can provide have attempted to use PostCSS. [Autoprexifer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is one common plugin one top of PostCSS that's being used.

Any developer who want to quickly bootstrap a web app can pick the web frameworks of his/her choice and let Yeoman generate the scaffolding of project structure."
  opinion: Indix picked upon yeoman generators like [React-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/yeoman-generator){:target='_blank'} and have active production app running on it. Indix is as well actively assessing the huge ecosystem of generators and will use them as need arises.

  ring: Trial
  isNew: true
  description: Google created [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/){:target='_blank'} principles with the intention to create a visual language and a single unified experience across platforms.
  opinion: Indix tried Material Design in one of its internal apps and is actively following its associated frameworks. The themes and the user experience are seamless and being actively adopted to Google applications. Indix is in wait and watch mode for extensive adoption of the technique, as the concept gives flexibility only to override the theme and colors of the visual elements, but not the feel and behaviour. Indix will move the technique to assess once Material design provides extensive overriding capabilities to fit the technique to Indix's visual theme and behaviour.
- name: Typed Javascript
  quadrant: Languages & Techniques
  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: Javascript being loosely typed, gives the developer flexibility to play with data types. While in some cases, this flexibility is useful, most of the cases, apps need to be strict-typed in-order to communicate with the backend.
  opinion: "[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are two frameworks which Indix assessed and picked upon Typescript being able to compile to JavaScript and catching type errors during compilation should be mentioned as a benefit compared to flow. The active community of TypeScript and its support for all the common libraries is added advantage."

  description: "[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's lightweight, efficient, event-driven model and carries a extensive community of plugins. "
  opinion: Indix adopted Node JS since its early satges and large set of internal tools use NodeJS and its plugins extensively to quickly bootstrap an app get it to production. Applying ES6 features and Typescript on top of Node JS proved to be a wholesome package of highly productive web apps. Indix runs apps on different versions of Node JS ranging from v6.0 to as recent as v7.5.

  isNew: true
  description: "[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is a highly-opiniated platform to build web, mobile and desktop apps with a same set of javascript code and connects database to end user's screen with high set of integrations."
  opinion: Indix assessed Metoer during its beta stage. We found apps being with lesser code and tighter integrations, but support of the community and set of frameworks on top of it were quite less at that time. Indix hs left meteor in assess stage and will pick it back in later part of 2017 to re-assess the framework.

  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: "[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/){:target='_blank'} is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript and adds static typing to the language."
  opinion: Indix intially had hard-time debugging non-typed JS and the turn-around time to fix an issue was very high. Such problems led us to explore possibilities of typed JavaScript. While assessing TypeScript in one of it's apps, we found that though the initial development time was more compared to developing in Javascript, but once the app hit production, maintainance of the app has been highly productive. Any new member joining the team found it easy to bootstrap on the code base. While existing projects continue to reamin in Javascript, any new project, TypeScript has become the default choice.

  ring: Assess
  isNew: true
  description: "[Koa](http://koajs.com/) is an alternate to Express+Connect with better support for error handling & middleware cascading. Koa is built using ES6 generators (with Koa v2 dropping around April 2017 with `async`/`await` support) and more lightweight."
  opinion: Indix designs lightweight server apps with pure REST API. Majority of the heavylifting is handled in client. For such lightweight server, express+connect fits as an apt combination. Koa has kept at assessing stage due its prons and cons. pros being the lightweight and cons being lesser supoort for routing and file serving.

  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML.
  opinion: React's benefits of composable components and intelligent state maintenance has made it the default client-side framework at Indix. It abstracts the DOM away from the app and implements one-way data flow, as an alternate to Angular's two-way binding. Moving from backbone, the learning curve initially seemed to slow things a little bit, but it made the team more productive over a longer period of time.
