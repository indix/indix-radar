  isNew: true
  description: '[ECMAScript 2015](http://es6-features.org/) (initially referred to as ES6) was finalized in June 2015 and introduces new syntax for writing complex applications (including classes & modules) and is generally a sorely needed upgrade to the language. As of Q1 2017, majority of the ES6 features are supported by the common browsers. The not supported ES6 features can be used with the [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler.'
  opinion: We have been an active adopter of ES6 features ever since it's inception, initially through transpilers and later as direct features. Apps written without ES6 features are being rewritten.

  isNew: true
  description: "[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability."
  opinion: We started using CoffeeScript in 2015. The primary reason was to reduce boiler plate code that we were writing due to JavaScript idiosyncarnies. Example - [Pros and cons of CoffeeScript](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/72569/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-coffeescript). It did improve our productivity during the time of usage and multiple apps based out of CoffeeScript run in production. But as of 2017 Q1, we no longer use it because ES2015/ES6 solves a lot of the problems that CoffeeScript was trying to solve without drastic syntax changes. Migration of existing apps to ES6 is in backlog and will be picked on case-by-case basis.

  description: "[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) is a JavaScript syntax extension that looks similar to XML. It is developed by Facebook and is acknowledged for the benefit of writing composable micro-components."
  opinion: We've been active users of React JSX ever since it's beta stage. The ability to define every UI element as a component and pass-on rich state to the components are very benefitial. Lesser number of bugs are being observed in production apps as the views are reactive to how the state of the app changes.

  description: "[Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) are a set of standards currently being produced by Google engineers as a W3C specification that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications."
  opinion: We assessed WebComponents in its early alpha stages and found it promising for the core concept of representing every visual item as a component. From the time it's assessed, the list of components repository has grown drastically and we're looking forward to trying Web Components in one of its upcoming project.

  description: "[LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is a CSS pre-processor; it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themeable and extendable."
  opinion: We're a major consumer of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and ever since Bootstrap made SASS as its default, LESS has been put on hold. All existing apps are already migrated to SASS.
- name: SASS

  description: "[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is an extension of CSS and defines a clean structured way of writing CSS by allowing to modularize CSS snippets while offering a whole slew of features which are practised in javascript environment. Features like variables, external imports, functions and extensibility allow to experience the benefits of modular patterns."
  opinion: Given its advantages, we actively adopt SASS for styling its web apps. SASS added defined structure to app styling code base and made it easily readable. The extensible nature allowed us to define low level themes and reuse it across apps.

  opinion: We picked up Yeoman generators like [React-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/yeoman-generator) and have active production apps running on then. We're also actively assessing the huge ecosystem of generators and will use them as need arises.

  description: Google created [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) principles with the intention to create a visual language and a single unified experience across platforms.
  opinion: We tried Material Design in one of our internal apps, and we're actively following its associated frameworks. The themes and the user experience are seamless and being actively adopted to Google applications. We're in wait-and-watch mode for extensive adoption of the technique, as the concept gives flexibility only to override the theme and colors of the visual elements, but not the feel and behaviour. We will move the technique to assess once Material design provides extensive overriding capabilities to fit the technique to our own visual theme and behaviour.

  isNew: true
  description: Javascript being loosely typed, gives the developer flexibility to play with data types. While in some cases, this flexibility is useful, most of the cases, apps need to be strict-typed in-order to communicate with the backend.
  opinion: "[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are two frameworks which we assessed; we ended up picking Typescript as it was better at catching type errors during compilation. The active community of TypeScript and its support for all the common libraries is another added advantage."

  description: "[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's lightweight, efficient, event-driven model and carries a extensive community of plugins. "
  opinion: We adopted Node.js since its early stages, and a large set of packages help us quickly bootstrap an app get it to production. Applying ES6 features and Typescript on top of Node.js proved to be a wholesome experience of building highly productive web apps. We runs apps on different versions of Node.js ranging from v6.0 to as recent as v7.7.x.

  description: "[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is a highly-opiniated platform to build web, mobile and desktop apps with a same set of javascript code and connects database to end user's screen with high set of integrations."
  opinion: We assessed Metoer during its beta stage. We found apps being with lesser code and tighter integrations, but support of the community and set of frameworks on top of it were quite less at that time. For now, we have left Meteor in the Assess stage and will pick it back in later part of 2017 to re-assess the framework.

  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: "[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript and adds static typing to the language."
  opinion: Intially, we had a hard-time debugging non-typed JS and the turn-around time to fix an issue was very high. Such problems led us to explore possibilities of typed JavaScript. While assessing TypeScript in one of it's apps, we found that though the initial development time was more compared to developing in Javascript, but once the app hit production, maintainance of the app has been highly productive. Any new member joining the team found it easy to bootstrap on the code base. While existing projects continue to reamin in Javascript, any new project, TypeScript has become the default choice.

  opinion: We design lightweight server apps with pure REST API. Majority of the heavylifting is handled in client. For such lightweight server, express+connect fits as an apt combination. Koa has kept at assessing stage due its prons and cons; pros being the lightweight and cons being lesser support for routing and file serving.

  ring: Adopt
  isNew: true
  description: "[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is an open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML."
  opinion: React's benefits of composable components and intelligent state maintenance has made it our default client-side framework. It abstracts the DOM away from the app and implements one-way data flow, as an alternate to Angular's two-way binding. Moving from backbone, the learning curve initially seemed to slow things a little bit, but it made the team more productive over a longer period of time.

  description: "[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) is a state container for JavaScript apps and helps the app to behave consistently."
